This repository contains a mix of coding challenges from various internet sources (advent of code, the riddler).
Solutions have been provided for using R, although should be relevant for most other programming languages.

Solutions are by no means optimal - these challenges can be solved in a variety of ways with tradeoffs for efficiency vs complexity vs coding time, etc.

Happy coding!
