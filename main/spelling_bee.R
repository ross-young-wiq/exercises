## PROBLEM -------------------------------------------------

# You have a honeycomb of letters: R (center), surrounded by A, E, G, I, N, T
# 
# You want to identify as many English-language words that meet the following criteria:
# 
# - The word must be at least four letters long.
# - The word must include the central letter of your honeycomb.
# - The word cannot include any letter beyond the seven given letters of the honeycomb.
# 
# Note that letters can be repeated. For example, the words AGAR and TRITE are both acceptable words. 
# Four-letter words are worth 1 point each, while five-letter words are worth 5 points, six-letter words are 
# worth 6 points, seven-letter words are worth 7 points, etc. 
# 
# Words that use all of the seven letters in the honeycomb are known as “pangrams” and earn 7 bonus points 
# (in addition to the points for the length of the word). So in the above example, GRANITE is worth 14 points.
# 
# If you got all possible words for this honeycomb, What would be your overall game score?
# 
# For consistency, please use this list of valid words as an input:
