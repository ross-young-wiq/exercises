## PROBLEM -------------------------------------------------

# Finance needs you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.
#
# Specifically, you need to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.
# 
# For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:
# 
# 1721
# 979
# 366
# 299
# 675
# 1456
# 
# In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. 
# Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.
# 
# Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; 
# what do you get if you multiply them together?

puzzle_input <- "main/00_data/report_repair.txt"



## YOUR SOLUTION -------------------------------------------







# PROBLEM -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to 2020 are 979, 366, and 675. 
# Multiplying them together produces the answer, 241861950.
# 
# In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?
